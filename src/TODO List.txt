- EdgePortion migth be fulty in case of really short paths
- don't ignore the last turn restriction
* include a variable for safe area capacity and then inforce it in your DJ code
- update the vertex huiristics after each evacuee loop... this needs some thinking
+ the flocking model is gonna take some time to implement

+ fix remaining cost of each edge for pop seperation
- fix multi-part turn to be accurate
- drop menu to select traffic model instead of cost calc model.
