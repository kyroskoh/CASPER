- EdgePortion might be faulty in case of really short paths
+ don't ignore the last turn restriction
* include a variable for safe area capacity and then enforce it in your DJ code
+ update the vertex heuristics after each evacuee loop... this needs some thinking
+ the flocking model is gonna take some time to implement

+ fix remaining cost of each edge for pop separation
- fix multi-part turn to be accurate
+ drop menu to select traffic model instead of cost calc model.

+ intelligently repeat the graph/vertex heuristic update after some paths are reserved. maybe size of closed list can help.
